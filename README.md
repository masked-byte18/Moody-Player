## 🚀 About the Project

**Moody Player** is a next-generation music player that uses **AI-powered facial expression analysis** to detect the user’s mood and play music that perfectly matches their emotions.

No manual playlists.  
No endless scrolling.  
Just **pure vibes, driven by AI**.

Users can upload their own songs, and the system intelligently categorizes them by mood to create a seamless, personalized listening experience.

## ⚡ Why Moody Player?

Because your face already knows what you want to hear 😌  
Moody Player reads your emotions in real time and turns them into music.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. 📸 The application accesses the user’s webcam  
2. 🎭 Facial expressions are analyzed using **face-api.js**  
3. 🤖 AI determines the user’s current mood  
4. 🎵 Songs mapped to that mood are fetched from the database  
5. 🔁 Music playback adapts dynamically as the mood changes
